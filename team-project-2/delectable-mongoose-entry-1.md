# `<img>`

## Introduction

The `<img>` element is **semantic element** used to specify an image in HTML markup.

What is a semantic element ?

An example of non-semantic element is a `div` whereas `<img>` is a semantic example.

A semantic element can clearly define its purpose and meaning to the web browser and most importantly to web developers. When you look at an `<img>` element tag, you instinctively know that it is used to specify an image in HTML markup. This is what semantic means.

## Basic Usage

The `<img>` element has two required attributes. Namely, `src` and `alt`.

**src**

```css
<img src="" alt="">
```

The required `src` attribute is used to specify the URL of the desired image. It can be a relative URL from the root of the html document, or an absolute URL to a specific web host.

```css
/* Relative Path */
<img src="path/to/img.png" alt="Demo !">

/*Absolute Path */
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/z0JBZ32.png" alt="Demo !">
```

**alt**

![demo](images/alt.png)

`alt` stands for alternate text. This attribute is used to specify an alternative text describing the image. This text will then be displayed if the image URL is wrong, or when the image fails to load as shown above.

```css
<img src="path/to/img.png" alt="Your alternate text here !">
```

## Other attributes

**width and height**

The `width` and `height`attribute is used to specify the width and height of the image.

```css
<img src="/path/to/original.png" alt="Demo !" width="200" height="200">
```

For example, if the original image has a width and height of 300x300px, the specified attribute will then alter the width and height of image to 200x200px, thereby shrinking the image in the process.

Tip:
You don't have to use the `width` and `height` attribute simultaneously. If you specify only either one of them, the browser is smart enough to calculate the resulting size of the image while preserving the exact proportion/scale of the image.

e.g.:


Specifying the **width only** will force the browser to calculate the proportionate height of the image, this technique is useful when you want to scale an image up or down proportionately.
```css
<img src="/path/to/original.png" alt="Demo !" width="200">
```

Similarly, specifying the **height only** will force the browser to calculate the proportionate width of the image, this technique is useful if you want to scale images up or down proportionately
```css
<img src="/path/to/original.png" alt="Demo !" height="200">
```
