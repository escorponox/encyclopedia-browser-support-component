# `text-outline`

> REMOVED FROM CSS3 Specification. DO NOT USE.

The CSS `text-outline` property defines an outline on the text with the following syntax:

```css
text-outline: length length color;
```

- The first length value represents the thickness of the outline.

- The second length value represents the blur radius of the outline.

- And the color value represents the color of the outline.

The `text-outline` property was specified in the CSS3 specification draft for [text manipulation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-text-20070306/#text-outline) under the category Text Decoration along side properties such as `text-shadow` and `text-emphasis`.

Even though those two other properties made it into the final CSS3 specification, the `text-outline` property did not.

## Notes

Due to the fact that the `text-outline` property did not make its way into the final CSS3 specification, it is not supported by any of the major browsers such as Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox. Therefore **this property should not be used at all**.

There are hopes that this property might make it into the [CSS4 specification](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/products/35) but everything is just speculation at this point.
