# `<strike>`

##Introduction

The `<strike>` element is semantic element used to specify a strikethrough text in HTML markup.

What is a semantic element ?

An example of non-semantic element is a div whereas `<strike>` is a semantic example.

A semantic element can clearly define its purpose and meaning to the web browser and most importantly to web developers. When you look at an `<strike>` element tag, you instinctively know that it is used to specify a strikethrough text in HTML markup. This is what semantic means.

## Usage
The `<strike>` element has no specific attributes. To strike a line through a text place it into an `<strike>` element:

```html
<strike>strikethrough text</strike>
```

The result is an strikethrough text:

<strike>strikethrough text</strike>

## Support
The `<strike>` tag is **not supported** in HTML5 and its usage is not recommended anymore. Instead, use `<del>` for deleted text or `<s>` for text that is no longer correct. Those tags provide proper semantics.
